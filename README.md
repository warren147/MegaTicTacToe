## Executing Program

## Inspiration

This game was inspired when I was playing Tic Tac Toe during class on my computer. I wanted to create something that was different than the 3x3 tic tac toe that we normally play, so I created this game with a bigger board and different rules (connect 5 Os or Xs). 

## Future Development

Adding one-player game mode(player vs. computer), a Bigger board, and possibly adding a third player.
